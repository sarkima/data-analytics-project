# Data Analytics Project

## Introduction

This project looked at the data on global defense companies to see if it could uncover insights into world complicts, geopolitical alliances, economic power and market trends. The project looked at three datasets on global defense manufacturers that covers revenue rankings, historic stock data, and segregation by country, region and political blocs.

It is fascinating how data on global defense companies can unveil insights regarding economic power, geopolitical alliances, and market trends. In this notebook, we explore three different datasets that cover a broad spectrum of information ranging from company segregation by country and political blocs to historical stock data and official revenue rankings by SIPRI. If you find these insights useful, please consider upvoting this notebook.
This is an individual project by the Code Institute to show my basic understanding of data analysis

## Data Sourcing

The datasets for the project was sourced at Kaggle. The dataset is based on the SIPRI Top 100 Arms-Producing and Military Services Companies (2023) and was kindly provided by Shreyansh Dangi at the following link [Top 100 Defense Companies Historical Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyanshdangi/worlds-top-100-defense-companies-historical-data?select=All+Listed+Companies+Combined+Historical++Data.csv)
